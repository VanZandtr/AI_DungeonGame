python test based game:

Included 5 classes to choose from, Skills, Leveling up, monsters, a battle system similar to JRPGs like pokemon. Give the player XP and equipment after winning battles. Allow player to upgrade their character and equip equipment that adds benefits to player stats. Make it maze based with multiple floors up to 4 with a boss fight. Make special rooms: some with monsters to fight, some to restore health and mana, some that give you equipment, and more.

Make it easy to add to the game.

Add a maze class that lets the player move through a randomly generate maze. Add 4 room types: empty, battle, regain health and mana, and a stairs room. Make 4 maze layers that the player moves through when they reach the "stairs" room. When they are on the last maze make a "boss" room that has a power enemy. If they beat the boss they win the game.

Can you add a game loop that takes player input. They should be allowed to "move n, s, e, w" based on the  maze layout. Print the new maze each move with an indicator of where the user player is.

great. make 4 more classes and add an input to let the player select which class they want to play. Add unique abilities and skills to each class that the  player gets on level up and can use in battle.

Print out the class description before the player selects the class.

This is perfect thanks! Can you add 3 more abilities to each class? Make it so these new abilities are each more powerful than the last but have higher mana costs and have them unlock at level 5, 10, and 15. 

Then allow the player to choose to use a specific skill in combat

Great can you change the map layout to be a shape other than a sqaure. Make it random layout with 15-20 rooms. Add Room types randomly through, but there is only 1 stairs room.

Keep all of this, but add special indicators to map printout for special rooms. "Empty" rooms should be displayed as ".".

Additionally add a "quit" input and a "legend" input that printouts what the map icons mean.
